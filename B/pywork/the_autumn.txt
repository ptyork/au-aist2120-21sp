5:    Close bosom-friend of the maturing sun;
7:    With fruit the vines that round the thatch-eves run;
8: To bend with apples the moss'd cottage-trees,
9:    And fill all fruit with ripeness to the core;
10:       To swell the gourd, and plump the hazel shells
12: And still more, later flowers for the bees,
13: Until they think warm days will never cease,
14:       For summer has o'er-brimm'd their clammy cells.
16: Who hath not seen thee oft amid thy store?
18: Thee sitting careless on a granary floor,
19:    Thy hair soft-lifted by the winnowing wind;
21:    Drows'd with the fume of poppies, while thy hook
22:       Spares the next swath and all its twined flowers:
26:       Thou watchest the last oozings hours by hours.
28: Where are the songs of spring? Ay, Where are they?
29:    Think not of them, thou hast thy music too,â€”
30: While barred clouds bloom the soft-dying day,
31:    And touch the stubble-plains with rosy hue;
32: Then in a wailful choir the small gnats mourn
33:    Among the river sallows, borne aloft
34:       Or sinking as the light wind lives or dies;
37:    The red-breast whistles from a garden-croft;
38:       And gathering swallows twitter in the skies.
